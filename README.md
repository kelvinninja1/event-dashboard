# Event Dashboard Concept Prototype

This is a concept, made by Ani Koleva, Atanas Bogoev and Kaloyan Kosev during our amazing SEP 2014 experience in USA.
> Event Dashboard helps event organisers manage and improve their events. It is a software solution for event organisers who use paper based feedback forms and evaluations. Event Dashboard is a platform that saves you time and efforts, gathering and analysing feedback from your participants. It provides you valuable and constructive feedback info-graphics and post-event analyses.

PS: Please don't look in the current state of the codebase, I wrote it during one sleepless night in Boston in 2014. No major changes since then! ;-)
